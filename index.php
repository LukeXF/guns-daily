				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p><strong>Gunsdaily was formed on Febuary 3rd 2013, just a few months after the horrible shooting at Sandy Hook school. Our main goal back then and still one of our goals today was to shine a less evil light on the topic that is guns. For many people, &nbsp;when they hear the word “gun” they get a bad conotation in their mind. They think of guns as &nbsp;“killing machine” or “baby killer”, Well we wanted to change that. As gun owners and gun enthusists we knew and know that guns are not evil and we wanted to spread this knowledge, and so began Gunsdaily.</strong></p>

				<h2>No Politics, Just Guns</h2>
				<p><strong>Our goal here at Gunsdaily is to create a place for all gun addicts and weapon enthusiasts to come &nbsp;for the latest gun news &nbsp;and awsome pictures and videos&nbsp;without having to worry about a politicized environment. One of the biggest things that keep people away from firearms is the politics that often surround the gun lifestyle. Well here at Gunsdaily there is no need to worry about politics, just enjoy the gun photos for what they are, awesome photos of awesome guns. </strong></p>
